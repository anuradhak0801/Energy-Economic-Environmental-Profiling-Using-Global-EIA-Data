# Energy-Economic-Environmental-Profiling-Using-Global-EIA-Data
Every country uses and produces energy — for electricity, transport, industries, and homes. But using energy also leads to pollution, especially when it comes from coal, oil, or gas. This pollution, called carbon emissions (CO₂), is a big reason for climate change.
At the same time, countries are trying to grow their economy (measured using GDP) and improve the quality of life for their people.
This project looks at how energy, environment, and economy are connected using real-world data from different countries.
